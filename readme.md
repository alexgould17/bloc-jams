# Welcome to bloc jams!
bloc jams is a simple music player app that I created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript & jQuery while completing the Web Developer Track at bloc.io. You can play, pause & stop songs, as well as navigate a rich, reactively-styled set of pages.

## To Use The App
Since this app is not currently hosted, you'll have to clone the code if you want to run it:
- Open the command line & use git to clone the repository by typing "git clone https://github.com/alexgould17/bloc-chat.git <your-repo-name>". Remember to replace <your-repo-name> with whatever you want the code repository to be called on your computer.
- Navigate to the directory where the code was installed, and open index.html
- Start playing around! The music player is fully functional & the distribution has preloaded mp3 files, so make sure your speakers are on!
- Try changing the size of your browser window, especially on the main page, and watch what happens!
